= Status Quo ü§î

What options do we have?

 * Change your VimL, restart Neovim.
   Kind of slow and disruptive.

 * Evaluate an entire file.
   Low fidelity!
   Requires if statements to prevent double execution of some code.

 * Evaluate an individual expression.
   Out of context, you can't see hidden state.
   Only global things can be interacted with.

 * VimL...
   I'm not smart enough to write interesting things with it.

____
I would say that VimL is like the PHP of editor scripting languages. It's by no
means a useless language, but the more you work with it, the more you find
yourself fighting against the countless quirks of the language.

It's usable, people make great things.

But we can do better.

= Conjure + Aniseed (Fennel) üßô

What do my tools give you?

 * Fennel https://fennel-lang.org/
   Macros! Structural editing! Consistent syntax!
   Feels like Clojure if that floats your boat.

 * Lua
   Don't have to see it, but we get LuaJIT levels of performance üòç
   Have access to any Lua library of snippet from around the internet.

 * Aniseed https://github.com/Olical/aniseed
   Bridges the gap between Fennel and Neovim.
   Adds a small Clojure like standard library.
   Built in test suite (runs in CI!).

 * Conjure https://github.com/Olical/conjure
   Evaluation of symbols, forms, buffers, files and more!
   Support for Aniseed, Janet and Clojure with a consistent UX.
   More languages in the future, including Common Lisp and Scheme.
   Non-Lisp languages when tree-sitter is normal in Neovim.

 * Better language (subjective-ish)
 * Faster runtime (LuaJIT FTW)
 * Minuscule feedback loop

= Ubiquity

Where can these ideas be applied?

 * Plugins
   At compile time or runtime as a library.
   Lua at rest, end users never actually touch Fennel.

 * Dotfiles
   Transparently compiled and evaluated, again, Lua at rest.
   https://github.com/Olical/dotfiles

 * Local directory configuration
   Just like vim-localvimrc, but Fennel.
   Same as dotfiles, Lua at rest, compiled when required.
   https://github.com/Olical/nvim-local-fennel

Use it for anything!

1-2 lines of VimL just to load the compiled Lua output.

= Language and Performance

 * LuaJIT is sometimes even on par with C! (not always)
   https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Lua-so-fast (Munchausen numbers)

     22.29s C
     23.29s Luajit
     26.33s PyPy
     54.30s Java
     92.94s NodeJS
     159.93s Lua
     416.55s Python

 * Vim 9+ may be faster?
   Requires syntax that won't be backwards compatible though.

 * VimL is a DSL (has benefits but I find it awkward for anything interesting).
   Fennel lets you design any DSL you want through macros.
   Lua is a really neat general purpose language.

 * LuaJIT is an absolute marvel of engineering.
 * Lua is so small it's hard to find a fault in it.
 * Fennel let's us extend it where it suits us.
